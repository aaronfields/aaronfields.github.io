Prep helps university students find on-demand tutoring in real time on college campuses and helps fellow students make real money tutoring their peers on their own time.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## [PhotoMunch | Restaurant Search App](https://aaronfields.github.io/yelpProject/)\r\nThis was a team project where we created a restaurant search app using the Yelp and Twitter APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## [WayBlazer + General Assembly Hackathon](http://aaronfields.github.io/wayblazer)\r\nWe won the hackathon with this project.

I implemented AsyncTask, SQLite, Picasso, and Espresso tests in this project.",
