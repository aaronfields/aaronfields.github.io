Prep helps university students find on-demand tutoring in real time on college campuses and helps fellow students make real money tutoring their peers on their own time.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## [PhotoMunch | Restaurant Search App](https://aaronfields.github.io/yelpProject/)\r\nThis was a team project where we created a restaurant search app using the Yelp and Twitter APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## [WayBlazer + General Assembly Hackathon](http://aaronfields.github.io/wayblazer)\r\nWe won the hackathon with this project. Travlr is a hotel search app that combines WayBlazer and Google Places APIs to provide itinerary suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## [Bookstore E-commerce App](http://aaronfields.github.io/book-store)\r\nI'm a big reader so for my first attempt at an ecommerce app I figured a bookstore was appropriate. I implemented AsyncTask, SQLite, Picasso, and Espresso tests in this project.",
